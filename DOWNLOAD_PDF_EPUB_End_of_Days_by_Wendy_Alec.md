End of Days by Wendy Alec Brothers at war. Mankind deceived. Hell on Earth. A man face down in the dirt amid melting Arctic snow, a deep sense of unease but no memory of how he got there â€“ Jason De Vere, once the head of a global media empire. Found and briefly taken to a safe house, Jasonâ€™s soon on the run again â€“ thereâ€™s a 50-million-dollar bounty if he can be taken alive. Thrown together with his ex-wife and a crusading young journalist, Jason begins a desperate search for answers. Itâ€™s a race against time, a fight for survival â€“ and the stakes are higher than he could possibly have imagined. 4 billion microchips â€“ promising miraculous benefits â€“ are being shipped to population centres around the world. And soon every human being on Earth will have to make a choiceâ€¦ CHRONICLES OF BROTHERS is the story of three brothers fighting for the future of humanity. From desert tombs, to the towers of Wall Street, to the ancient past, this super-epic tale reveals the hidden history of mankind and the origins of evil itself.
