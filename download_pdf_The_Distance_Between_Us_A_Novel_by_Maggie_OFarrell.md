Overview
Gripping, insightful, and deft, The Distance Between Us by Maggie O&#039;Farrell is a haunting story of the way our families shape our lives, from the award-winning author of Hamnet and The Marriage Portrait.
 
 On a cold February afternoon, Stella catches sight of a man she hasn&#039;t seen for many years, but instantly recognises. Or thinks she does. At the same moment on the other side of the globe, in the middle of a crowd of Chinese New Year revellers, Jake realises that things are becoming dangerous.
 
 They know nothing of one another&#039;s existence, but both Stella and Jake flee their lives: Jake in search of a place so remote it doesn&#039;t appear on any map, and Stella for a destination in Scotland, the significance of which only her sister, Nina, will understand.
