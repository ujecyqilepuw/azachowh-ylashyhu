Dive into the most mysterious waters around the world (if you dare) in Spooky Lakes, an illustrated nonfiction book from TikTok star and educator Geo Rutherford
 
 From Geo Rutherfordâ€”the creator of the hit series Spooky Lake Month (over 65 million likes!)â€”comes this thrilling nonfiction book that plumbs the depths of 25 unusual lakes around the world.
 
 Backed by extensive research and packed with all-new contentâ€”including eerie and eye-popping watercolor illustrations in full colorâ€”Spooky Lakes takes readers on an adventure through weird and wild waters.
 
 Some of Earthâ€™s strangestâ€”and creepiestâ€”wonders lie deep below the surface...
 
 Thereâ€™s Lake Natron, a Tanzanian lake so briny that its waters can mummify any creature that touches its surface; Lake Maracaibo, a Venezuelan tidal bay where a constantly brewing storm sends an average of 28 lightning bolts per second into the water; and at the bottom of Lake Superior, the crew of the USS Kamloopsâ€”which mysteriously disappeared in 1921â€”remains somehow almost perfectly preserved to this day.
 
 Readers will learn not only about the science of hydrology, but why understanding the natural world is crucial to protecting it from pollution and climate change.
 
 Includes a glossary, bibliography, authorâ€™s note, and index.
