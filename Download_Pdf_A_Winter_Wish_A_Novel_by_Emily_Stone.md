Overview
When an unexpected inheritance forces two total opposites to work together, Lexie must decide if Theo is going to push her outâ€”or pull her in for the kiss of a lifetimeâ€”in this heartwarming holiday novel from the author of Always, in December and One Last Gift
 
 When Lexie learns of her fatherâ€™s death, she doesnâ€™t know how to feel; theyâ€™ve barely spoken in the last ten years. And sheâ€™s even more confused when she discovers heâ€™s left her half of his holiday travel company, a successful niche business specializing in trips that explore the holiday traditions of cultures all over the world.
 
 Meanwhile, the other half of the company has been left to her fatherâ€™s handsome but bad-tempered young executive, Theo. And the will stipulates that the two of them must find a way to run the company together for a year before they decide its fate.
 
 Lexie intends to leave once the year is over, even though, as a wanderer herself, she finds the companyâ€™s mission more compelling than she first thought. And a work trip to sizzling Spain reveals a chemistry between Lexie and Theo that is impossible to deny.
 
 There may have been some snap judgments made about each other. But mixing business and pleasure isnâ€™t always a good idea.
