Overview
One impulsive lie leads to a weeklong adventure of fake dating for two bickering coworkers in this swoony destination wedding rom-com by Sajni Patel, author of The Trouble with Hating You.
 
 Sunshine incarnate Bhanu brings big UX energy to whatever she does, including going for the promotion where her only serious competition is her work nemesis, AKA Sunny, the grump with the Denzel voice. She expected to get a reprieve from him while visiting her family in Hawaiâ€™i, but the universe has other plans. When Bhanu runs into Sunny at the hotel and witnesses his ex criticizing him about being single, Bhanu does the first thing that comes to mind: she impetuously claims to be Sunnyâ€™s girlfriend just to get some peace and quiet. Except Sunny is on island for a friendâ€™s wedding and his ex has already texted the entire wedding party about this mysterious girlfriend.
 
 Bhanu truly is the bane of Sunnyâ€™s existence. But the last thing he wants to do is cause tension during his friendâ€™s wedding festivities, much less be the object of their pity. He has no choice except to play along, if only he and Bhanu can put aside their quarreling and act like a real couple.
 
 Between Bhanuâ€™s hilariously meddling family and Sunnyâ€™s ecstatic friends, the two are pushed closer together, even as stress mounts over the impending promotion.
 
 They say what happens on island, stays on island. But as Sunny and Bhanu let their guards down, will either of them be able to resist this romantic getaway without crossing the line?
